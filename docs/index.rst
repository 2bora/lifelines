looking for methods to solve a common problem:

    How do I predict lifetimes, or time to events?

The statistical tool that answers this question is *survival analysis*.
*lifelines* is a implementation of survival analysis in Python. What
benefits does *lifelines* offer over other survival analysis
implementations?

-  built ontop of Pandas
-  internal plotting methods
-  simple and intuitive API (*designed for humans*)
-  only does survival analysis (No unnecessary features or second-class
   implentations)
