lifelines
=====================================
Survival Analysis in Python
-------------------------------------


The **lifelines**
library provides a powerful tool to data analysts and scientists
looking for methods to solve a common problem:

    How do I predict durations?

This question seems very vague and abstract, but that's only because we
can be so general in this space. Some more specific questions
*lifelines* will help you answer are:

    How long can I expect a user to be on my service? Which treatment
    group takes longer to complete an action? When is the next event
    likely to happen? Which factors influence durations of events?

The statistical tool that answers these questions is survival analysis.
*lifelines* is a implementation of survival analysis in Python. What
benefits does *lifelines* offer over other survival analysis
implementations?

-  built ontop of Pandas
-  internal plotting library
-  simple and intuitive API (*designed for humans*)
-  only does survival analysis! (No unnecessary features or second-class
   implentations)

Installation

``pip install lifelines``
