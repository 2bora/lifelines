    This is a very flexible function for transforming arrays of start_times and end_times 
    to the proper format for lifelines: duration and censorship arrays.

    Parameters:
        start_times: an array, series or dataframe of start times. These can be strings, or datetimes.
        end_times: an array, series or dataframe of end times. These can be strings, or datetimes.
                   These values can be None, or an empty string, which corresponds to censorship.
        fill_date: the date to use if end_times is a None or empty string. This corresponds to last date 
                  of observation.
        freq: the units of time to use. Default 'D' for days. See pandas freq 
        day_first: convert assuming European-style dates, i.e. day/month/year. 
        na_values : Additional string to recognize as NA/NaN. 

    Returns:
        T: a array of floats representing the durations with time units given by freq.
        C: a boolean array of censorship: 1 if death observed, 0 else.
